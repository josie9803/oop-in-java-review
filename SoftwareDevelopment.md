# Software Development
## Software Development workflow/process
1. Requirements
2. Analysis and Design 
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment and Maintenance

### 1. Requirements engineering
1. Requirements elicitation:
- *What do the stakeholders/users want?*
- Communicate with stakeholders
2. Requirements specification:
- *What exactly are we doing?*
- User requirements, system requirements
3. Requirements validation:
- *Can we do these things?*
- Feasibility studies, prototyping

### 2. Analysis and Design
1. Architectural Design:

- [Design techniques](#design-techniques)

2. Security by Design:
3. User Interface and User Interaction:

### 4. Testing
can be divided by *who* runs the tests:
1. Development testing (by developers)
- Unit testing, integration testing, structural (white-box) testing, etc
2. Release testing (by testers)
- Functional (black-box) testing, acceptance testing, etc
3. User testing (by users)
- Alpha testing, beta testing, etc

Testing can and should be integrated into development

## Software Process Models
- How do we schedule the software development workflow?
1. Waterfall model
2. Incremental development model
3. Agile

### 1. Waterfall model
- Each step must be completed before the next
- Problems:

### 2. Incremental development model
- Produce an *initial version* ASAP
- Problem: Repeat *software development workflow* for each version

### 3. Agile
- a development methodology based on **iterative** and **incremental** approach
#### Agile values
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
#### Agile implementation:
1. Scrum: an implementation of agile in which **incremental** changes are delivered **timely**
2. Extrememe Programming (XP)
   - Pair Programming

# Design Techniques:
### 1. CRC Cards:
- **C**lass **R**esponsibility & **C**ollaborator Cards
- used for initial design
### 2. Unified Model Language (UML):
- generalized set of rules on how to present a model
- used for documenting a design
1. Behavioral diagrams:
- use case diagram
2. Structural diagrams:
- [class diagram](#uml-class-diagram) 

### UML Class diagram:
- a diagram showing classes and their relationships, methods and fields.
- 6 types of relationships:
